# Documentation for Brock's Contribution

> I was in charge of the text and design of the website. I also helped make guide text for the user to places around the website so that they are not confused and know what kind of website it is. I also helped some of the team focus on another job when they finished theirs. I did most of the html paragraphs and helped others find new edits work on the webpage when they were done with their job.

> This is a sample of the about page and what the company is about. This uses paragraph tags with with h2 tags to organize them. The text of the content is white to make it easier to read over the about pages dark red color, and the font-size is 1.4em so that the text is big enough for everyone to read.

```html
<div id="aboutpgstory" style="color:white; font-size:1.4em; ">

> Here is a snipet of the css so that set the line height to 30 pixels made the color white that went with the dark red background. I made the font for the headers Poppins so that it was easier to read the headers and the text.

```css
div#aboutpgstory p {
  color: white;
  line-height: 30px;
}

#h2story {
  font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
}
```

> I designed and found ways to use some of our colors in the webpage like the homepage and about page.

> The challeges that I faced during the building of the Website was how detailed I had to be when it came to text size, fonts, the arrangement of text, and placement of elements on the page such as box shadows. Another challenge I faced was having everything be within the aspects of everyones approval.

> The box shadow took time to fit peoples ideals and also took time to fit around the images of the page.
> Eventualy we all came to an agreement and I took some time to fit the box shodow to the images with out the shadows overlapping eachother.

```css
box-shadow: 2px 3px 8px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
```
