# Documentation for Isaac's contribution

> Here's some info about my contribution: I worked initially on making cropping and removing backgrounds from images that we'd use on the site with gimp. However, after getting a total of 3 images ready for the site, my team members found a much more efficient method of generating images for our website. With the help of an AI image generator, my team members could quickly generate quality images which functioned at multiple resolutions: exactly what the project needed, and it eleviated the need for me to work with images in gimp.
> Afterwards, I was tasked with making a "cart" functionality to our website working heavilly with javaScript. After about 2 weeks of coding in javaScript, I was able to make it so that each item displayed on the homepage had a given price, and when clicked on, the items' prices would be added to the total deductable. Then, I would take that data from the homepage and transfer it to the cart page. That way the cart page would display the the individual items the user bought, make it so that the items could be bought, resetting the cart page of items, and make it so that any items displayed on the page could be removed from the list.

```js
console.log("some cool code");
